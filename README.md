# üí∏ Pricing Optimization Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to optimize pricing strategies by simulating a real-world retail environment. Through data generation, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, the project identifies optimal pricing points to maximize revenue based on customer demand, competition, and other key factors.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Simulate a dataset that mimics real-world pricing conditions
- Explore relationships between price, demand, marketing, and competition
- Build a machine learning model to predict demand
- Identify pricing strategies that maximize revenue

## üß™ Dataset Description

The dataset was synthetically generated to represent a business environment from 2020 to 2023 with the following features:

| Feature             | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Price`             | Selling price per unit                          |
| `Demand`            | Quantity of units demanded                      |
| `COGS`              | Cost of Goods Sold                              |
| `Marketing_Spend`   | Advertising and promotional expenses            |
| `Customer_Segments` | Categorical: High, Medium, Low                  |
| `Seasonality`       | Categorical: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall       |
| `Competitor_Price`  | Price of the same product by competitors        |
| `Date`              | Randomized dates from 2020 to 2023              |

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations were created using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` to explore:

- Price distribution vs Competitor pricing
- Price vs Demand trends
- Effects of seasonality and marketing spend
- Time series trends across quarters and years

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

A **Decision Tree Regressor** was used to predict demand based on input variables:

### Model Features
- `Price`
- `COGS`
- `Marketing_Spend`
- `Competitor_Price`
- Encoded `Customer_Segments` and `Seasonality`

### Evaluation Metrics
- `R¬≤ Score`: Model explanatory power
- `Mean Squared Error`: Accuracy of predictions

The model was used to simulate and test multiple pricing scenarios to estimate revenue and identify optimal pricing strategies.

## üìà Revenue Optimization

Predicted revenue = `Price √ó Predicted Demand`

- Simulated multiple pricing scenarios
- Calculated expected revenue for each
- Identified price points that **maximize total revenue**
